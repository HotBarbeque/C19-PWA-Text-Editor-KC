## Description

A single-page text editor that meets the PWA criteria, runs in the browser, and functions offline. It features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser.


## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Right click on package.json and select "Open in Integrated Terminal"

Enter <code>npm i</code> to install the dependencies.

Enter <code>npm start</code> to start the app at localhost:3000 in browser.

## Usage

Visit the deployed site below. When you enter text it will save automatically when you click off of the window. If you refresh or revist the text will remain. If you go offline it will store your changes until you are back online. It is downloadable as a seperate app.
